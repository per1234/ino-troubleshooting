#### "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

#### Informational output vs warning vs error
The Arduino development software outputs a variety of information. Just because you see some text in the console, doesn't mean there is a problem. Error messages will usually contain the word "error". It's a good idea to pay attention to warnings, but they don't always indicate a problem. If the output doesn't contain the word "error" or "warning", it's probably just some helpful informational output and doesn't indicate any problem.
