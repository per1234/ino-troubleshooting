#### How do I embed an image in my forum post?
Please don't post images of text to the Arduino Forum. Post text as text! However, there are times where it is useful to post an image. The best way to do this is to attach the image to the post and then embed the image in the post. Attaching the image to the post rather than uploading it to some external image hosting site avoids the topic suffering bit rot as the image is later deleted from the external site. Embedding the image makes it so that forum members can easily see it without needing to download the file (which many can't or won't do).
1. Click the "Attachments and other options" at the bottom of the forum post window. If you are making a reply, you must click the "Reply" button before you'll see this link.
1. Click the "Browse" button.
1. Select the image you want to attach.
1. Click the "Open" button.
1. Click the "Post" button.
1. At the bottom of your post, you will see a download link for the image you attached. Right click on that link.
1. From the context menu, click "Copy Link Location".
1. At the bottom right corner of the post, click "More...".
1. Click "Modify".
1. Place the cursor at the location you want to embed the image.
1. Click the "Insert an image" button on the forum post toolbar (looks like a photograph with a + on the corner).
1. Press **Ctrl + V** to paste the copied image URL into the "Enter the image URL" field.
1. Click the "OK" button.
1. Click the "Save" button
